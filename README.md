* **This is a Node+Express.js REST API, <a href="www.playfab.com">PlayFab</a> (BaaS) wrapper, and other experimental wrappers/integartions with MVC architecture.**
* API Originally made for Throne of Lies: The Online Game of Lies and Deceit @ https://api.ThroneOfLies.com for https://www.ThroneOfLies.com

## PreReqs:
Although it's **highly recommended to just pull SNIPPET EXAMPLES from here since it's experimental and an on-going WIP**, if you're still daring enough to clone, good luck - here are some basic instructions:
1. Edit "rename_me_to_secret-keys.json" file in `/tol2/data/` and replace placeholder values.
2. Rename "rename_me_to_secret-keys.json" to "secret-keys.json" and fill in your secret keys (remember the key names)
3. SSL/TLS (https) is required for out-of-box use: Copy your `cert.pem` and `key.pem` files to `/tol2/ssl/`
4. Navigate to **/tol2/** and type `sudo npm install --save` to install the req's `/tol2/node_modules/` dir)
5. I use 'npm run dev' for debugging and 'npm run forever' for production.

## Scripts:
`package.json` comes with two "dev" scripts - run via `npm run <script_name>`:

1. `forever` - type `sudo npm run forever` to run forever+nodemon together to keep your app going and restart on changes, automatically.
2. `kill` - type `sudo npm run kill` to kill forever+nodemon. TODO: Don't kill everything, be selective.
3. `restart` - calls npm `kill`, then npm `forever`
4. `dev` - Debugging mode

## PlayFab Example:
`/tol2/routes/playfab.js`
```
// https://api.playfab.com/Documentation/Client/method/LoginWithPlayFab
router.post('/loginwithpf', cors(corsOptions), (req, res) => {
    // Init
    PFInitPost(req, '/loginwithpf');

    // Send
    PlayFabClient.LoginWithPlayFab(req.body, (err, data) => {
        PFGenericCallback(res, err, data);
    });
});
```

## Mailchimp Example:
`/tol2/routes/mailchimp.js`
```
// REGISTER
router.post('/register', cors(corsOptions), (req, res) => {
    // Init
    MCInitPost(req, '/register');
    var email = req.body["email"];
    var username = req.body["username"];
    var emailMd5 = GetMd5(email);
    var url = `/lists/${i42ListId}/members/${emailMd5}`;

    console.log("MC: PUT >> " + url);
    mailchimp.put(url, {
        "email_address": email,
        "status": "pending",
        "merge_fields": {
            "EMAIL": email,
            "UNAME": username
        }
    }, (err, data) => {
        // Generic callback + res
        mcGenericCallback(err, data, req, res);
    });
});
```
